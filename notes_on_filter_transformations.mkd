# Transformations of convolutional filters 

## Idea 
To transform the filters according to the input /part of the image we are convolving on at a time.

## Goal:
- decrease the number of filters, 
- increase in accuracy

## Experiments:
### Task:
Digit classification

### Network setup: 
#### Baseline:
4 CNN layers followed by maxpool
2 Dense layers (256 and 10 neurons)
Dropout: 0.3 rate
Epochs: 110
Optimizer: Adam

### Dataset 
Cluttered MNIST

### Results
#### Experiment 1: 
#### Setup:
Rotated filter layer: Convolutional layer where every filter is rotated to 45 degrees and stacked together. The output of this layer is the element wise maximum of the convolution output.

| Model  | Validation accuracy | Test accuracy| Validation loss | Test loss
| ------------- | ------------- |-------------|-----------------|-----------|
|  Baseline  | 93.02  | 93.25 | 0.34501| 0.33128|
| All 4 conv layers with 3 rotated filters  | 92.8  | 93.08| 0.261119 | 0.252387| 
| All 4 conv layers with 2 rotated filters  | 92.5  | 92.09| 0.30970 | 0.3239| 
| All 4 conv layers with 1 rotated filters  | 92.9  | 92.95| 0.3904366 | 0.36607|

### Findings
- If we use a rotated filter layer as the first convlolutional layer, the accuracy drop significantly to 3-4 points compared to the baseline
- For all the other layers, the accuracy is not very different when compared with applying the rotational convolutional layer to deeper layers.
- The accuracy with just one rotational layer is the highest though with a marginal difference.
- The accuracy is not very different when only 4 rotations are used vs 8 rotations.
